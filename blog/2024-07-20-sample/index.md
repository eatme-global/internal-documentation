Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory and they will be autogenerated as blogs.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:
![Sample Image](./sample.jpg)
