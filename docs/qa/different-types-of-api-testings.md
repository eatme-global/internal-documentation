title: Different types of API Testings
---

Functional Testing:

- Endpoint Testing: Test each API endpoint individually, ensuring it behaves as expected. Verify that the endpoint returns the correct response for different inputs and scenarios.
- HTTP Method Testing: Test each endpoint with various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to ensure they perform the intended actions and handle the requests appropriately.
- Error Handling: Verify that the API responds correctly to invalid requests by returning appropriate error messages with the correct HTTP status codes.
- Response Validation: Validate that the response data format (JSON, XML, etc.) matches the expected format and structure defined in the API documentation.

Performance Testing:

- Response Time Testing: Measure the response times of API requests under normal conditions to ensure they meet performance requirements.
- Stress Testing: Send a large number of requests simultaneously to determine how the API performs under heavy load and identify any performance bottlenecks.
- Scalability Testing: Gradually increase the load on the API and monitor its performance to ensure it scales effectively with growing usage.

Security Testing:

- Authentication and Authorization: Verify that the API requires proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- Vulnerability Testing: Test for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- Data Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data transmitted over the network is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
- Data Privacy: Validate that sensitive information is not exposed in error messages or responses, and access controls are in place to restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.

Data Integrity Testing:

- Database Testing: Verify that data is stored and retrieved accurately from the database, and any CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed correctly.
- Data Validation: Test that data validation rules are enforced properly, preventing invalid or incomplete data from being accepted by the API.

API Integration Testing:

- Interoperability Testing: Test how the API interacts with other systems or components it integrates with, ensuring data consistency and compatibility.
- Data Flow Testing: Verify that data passed between different APIs or modules is consistent and accurate, without loss or corruption.

Usability Testing:

- Documentation Review: Evaluate the API documentation for clarity, completeness, and correctness, ensuring that it provides clear guidance on how to use the API.
- Developer Experience: Test the ease of use of the API by attempting to implement it based on the provided documentation, identifying any ambiguities or difficulties.

Edge Case Testing:

- Boundary Testing: Test boundary conditions and edge cases to ensure the API behaves correctly under unusual circumstances, such as large input sizes, special characters, or extreme values.
- Failure Testing: Simulate various failure scenarios (e.g., network interruptions, server failures) and verify that the API handles them gracefully without crashing or corrupting data.

Regression Testing:

- Revalidation: Repeatedly test previously validated functionalities after making changes or updates to the API to ensure that new developments haven't introduced any regressions or broken existing functionality.
