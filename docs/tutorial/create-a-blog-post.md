# Create a Blog Post

Docusaurus creates a **page for each blog post**, but also a **blog index page**, a **tag system**, an **RSS** feed...

## Create your first Post

Create a file at `blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md`:

```md title="blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md"
---
slug: greetings
title: Greetings!
authors:
  - name: Joel Marcey
    title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
    url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
    image_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png
  - name: Sébastien Lorber
    title: Docusaurus maintainer
    url: https://sebastienlorber.com
    image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png
tags: [qa, development]

Congratulations, you have made your first post!

Feel free to play around and edit this post as much as you like.
```

A new blog post is now available at [https://docs.eatmeglobal.org/blog/greetings](https://docs.eatmeglobal.org/blog/greetings).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory and they will be autogenerated as blogs.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

## Adding multiple images

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images. So when you have multiple images for a blog post you can put all of them inside that folder.

```md
blogs
|-- 2019-05-30-welcome.md
└── 2019-05-30-images
|-- index.md
|── sample-image-1.jpg
└── sample-image-1.jpg
```

Then you can just refer to them inside the blog post using relative path.

```md
![Sample Image](./sample.jpg)
```

## Tags

The blog supports tags as well. Tags should be added to `tags.yml` before using them.

## Truncating

Use a `<!--` `truncate` `-->` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.

<!--truncate-->

```md
This is the summary of this blog post

<!--truncate-->

Rest of the blog post goes here
```

In the above example only `This is the summary of this blog post` part will be visible on the page with all the blog posts.

## Interactive Blog Posts

You can create interactive blog posts using MDX. For that you have to create files with the `.mdx` extension.

```md
---
slug: mdx-blog-post
title: MDX Blog Post
authors:
  name: John Doe
  title: Content Writer
  url: https://github.com/wgao19
  image_url: https://github.com/wgao19.png
tags: [qa, development, ba, pm, automation, git, react, rn]
---

Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

:::tip

Use the power of React to create interactive blog posts.

` ``
<button onClick={() => alert("button clicked!")}>Click me!</button> ` ``

<button onClick={() => alert("button clicked!")}>Click me!</button>

:::
```
