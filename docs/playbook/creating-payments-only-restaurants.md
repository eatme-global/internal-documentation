Example 1 : https://www.google.com/maps/place/Geylang+Serai+Market+and+Food+Centre/@1.3159515,103.901085,17.28z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1819b7879c71:0xc79b3c9fb27e5e34!4m12!1m5!3m4!2zMcKwMTknMDAuOCJOIDEwM8KwNTQnMDEuNyJF!8m2!3d**1.3168913**!4d**103.9004756**!3m5!1s0x31da1810a1928cf5:0xe32ae7206bb3ada7!8m2!3d1.3167284!4d103.8982767!16s%2Fg%2F11b76gjzdf?entry=ttu
4. Example 2 : https://www.google.com/maps/place/Champion+Hotel/@1.3142633,103.8981148,17.14z/data=!3m1!5s0x31da1810de257e55:0xb672453c5681d682!4m15!1m5!3m4!2zMcKwMTknMDAuOCJOIDEwM8KwNTQnMDEuNyJF!8m2!3d**1.3168913**!4d**103.9004756**!3m8!1s0x31da1810de3b7785:0xf27e433cae335ed0!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d1.3147698!4d103.8983936!16s%2Fg%2F11b6b0tj9y?entry=ttu
