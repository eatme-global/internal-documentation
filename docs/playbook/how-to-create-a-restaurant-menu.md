# 1. Creating a Menu Template for Data Extraction

This guide provides instructions on creating a structured spreadsheet template for extracting and organizing menu data provided by restaurants. The template is designed to standardize the data collection process, ensuring consistency and completeness. The following sections outline the steps and components of the template.

---

## 1.1 Create a New Spreadsheet

- Open your preferred spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets).
- Create a new spreadsheet and name it appropriately, such as "Restaurant Menu Data or Setup".

---

## 1.2 Column Headers

- In the first row, create the following column headers to capture the necessary information:
  - **Category **
  - **Sub-Category**
  - **Item Name**
  - **Description**
  - **Choices**
  - **Add-Ons**
  - **Price**
  - **Notes**
  - **Status**

---

# 2. Template Layout

## 2.1 Category and Sub-Category

-  Create a column for the main category of the menu items. Examples of categories include **Desserts, Beverages, Snacks,** etc.
- Create a column for any sub-categories under the main category. For example, under Desserts, you might have sub-categories like **Ice Creams, Chocolate Mousse, or Cheesecakes**.

---

## 2.2 Item Details

- Create a column for entering the name of the menu item.
- Create a column for providing a brief description of the menu item.

---

## 2.3 Choices and Add-Ons

- Create a column for listing any choices available for the item, such as different sizes, flavors, or preparation methods.
- Create a column for listing any available add-ons for the item, such as extra toppings or sides.

---

## 2.4 Pricing

- Create a column for entering the price of the menu item. Note that some item prices might be zero and will be determined according to the choices selected. For example, a base item might have a price of $0.00, and the final price will depend on the selected choices listed in the Choices column.

---

## 2.5 Additional Notes

- Create a column for entering any additional notes or comments relevant to the item, such as special instructions or dietary information.

---

## 2.6 Status

- Create a column for tracking the status of each item using a dropdown menu. The dropdown should have the following values:
  - To Add
  - In Progress
  - Completed
- This column helps monitor the progress of data entry and ensures all items are accounted for.

---

# 3. Subsections for Add-Ons and Choices

## 3.1 Add-Ons Group

- Create a subsection within the spreadsheet for different groups of add-ons. This section should include columns for:
  - **Name**
  - **Price**
  - **Status**

---

## 3.2 Choice Groups

## 3.2 Choice Groups

- Create separate groups for different choice categories (e.g., sizes, flavors). Each group should have columns for:
  - **Choice**
 - **Price** (if applicable; if all choices have the same price, this column can be left blank since the price will be on the item)
  - **Status**
